# React Mini-Learnings Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my React mini-learnings repository! This repository is dedicated to storing mini exercises and fundamental concepts in React. I use this repository to reinforce my understanding of important concepts and to quickly refer back to them whenever needed.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal learning resource where I can document and practice fundamental concepts in React. By working on mini exercises and documenting my learnings, I aim to solidify my understanding and become more proficient in React development.

- Controlled Elements with form
- State Uplifting
  (declaring the state in parent component and then pass it to the child components or siblings components)
- Component Composition (sending props to nested components via {children})

Happy learning, and enjoy exploring the world of React!
